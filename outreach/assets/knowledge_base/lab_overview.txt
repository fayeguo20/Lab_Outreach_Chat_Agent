# Hickey Lab Overview - Duke University

## About the Lab
The Hickey Lab at Duke University sits at the interface of engineering and immunology. Led by Dr. John Hickey, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, the lab uses and develops systems immunology tools to investigate tissue structure in situ (in its original location). The lab has secondary appointments in the Departments of Cell Biology and is part of the Center for Advanced Genomic Technologies.

## Research Focus Areas
The Hickey Lab research spans three interconnected areas:

### 1. Spatial Omics & Tissue Mapping
We use cutting-edge multiplexed imaging technologies like CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) to create detailed maps of tissues at single-cell resolution. This allows us to see not just what cells are present, but WHERE they are located and how they interact with their neighbors. Our work on the human intestine mapped the spatial organization of cells across the entire gut, revealing how different cell types are arranged to maintain tissue function.

### 2. Computational Modeling & Simulation
We develop mathematical and computational models to understand immune cell behavior. This includes agent-based models that simulate how T cells move, interact, and make decisions in complex environments like tumors. By combining real imaging data with computational simulations, we can test hypotheses about why certain therapies work or fail.

### 3. Machine Learning & Algorithm Development
We create new computational tools and algorithms to analyze the massive datasets generated by spatial omics technologies. This includes methods for cell segmentation, tissue classification, and identifying meaningful patterns in complex biological images.

## Key Technologies We Use
- CODEX multiplexed imaging (40+ protein markers simultaneously)
- Single-cell RNA sequencing
- Agent-based modeling and simulation
- Deep learning for image analysis
- Spatial statistics and neighborhood analysis

## Research Applications
Our work has applications in:
- Cancer immunotherapy (understanding why some patients respond and others don't)
- Inflammatory diseases (IBD, autoimmune conditions)
- Tissue atlas creation (mapping healthy human organs)
- Drug development (predicting therapy outcomes)

## Why Location Matters
Traditional methods look at cells in isolation. But cells don't exist in isolation - they communicate with their neighbors, respond to their local environment, and organize into functional structures. By studying cells in their spatial context, we can understand biology that would be invisible with conventional approaches.

# Summary of Key Publications

## Paper 1: Organization of the Human Intestine at Single-Cell Resolution (Nature, 2023)
**What we did:** Used CODEX multiplexed imaging to create a comprehensive spatial map of the human intestine from 8 donors.
**Key findings:** 
- Mapped 64 tissue sections covering ~16 mm² of intestinal tissue
- Identified how different cell types (immune cells, epithelial cells, structural cells) are spatially organized
- Discovered patterns in how cells arrange themselves from the intestinal surface down to deeper tissue layers
- Created a reference atlas for healthy human gut organization
**Why it matters:** Understanding normal tissue organization helps us identify what goes wrong in diseases like inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer.

## Paper 2: Integrating Multiplexed Imaging and Multiscale Modeling to Study T Cell Behavior in Tumors (Cell Systems, 2024)
**What we did:** Combined CODEX imaging of tumors with agent-based computational models to understand how T cells behave in the tumor microenvironment.
**Key findings:**
- Measured how T cells are distributed spatially within tumors
- Built simulations to model T cell movement, interactions, and killing of cancer cells
- Identified factors that determine whether T cells can effectively infiltrate and attack tumors
- Showed how the spatial arrangement of cells affects immunotherapy outcomes
**Why it matters:** This helps explain why immunotherapy works for some cancer patients but not others, and could guide development of better treatments.

## Paper 3: Machine Learning Methods for Spatial Omics Analysis
**What we did:** Developed new computational algorithms for analyzing multiplexed imaging data.
**Key findings:**
- Created methods for accurately identifying cell boundaries in crowded tissues
- Developed approaches for classifying tissue regions and cell types
- Built tools for quantifying cell-cell interactions and neighborhood composition
**Why it matters:** Better analysis tools mean more accurate biological insights from spatial omics experiments. These methods are used by researchers worldwide.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is spatial omics?
Spatial omics refers to technologies that measure molecular information (like proteins or RNA) while preserving the spatial location of cells within a tissue. Unlike traditional methods that require grinding up tissue, spatial omics lets us see the organization of cells in their natural context.

## What is CODEX?
CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) is a multiplexed imaging technology that can measure 40+ different proteins in the same tissue section. It works by using DNA-barcoded antibodies and sequential imaging cycles to build up a complete picture of tissue composition.

## What is agent-based modeling?
Agent-based modeling is a computational approach where individual "agents" (like cells) follow simple rules about how to move and interact. By simulating many agents together, we can understand complex behaviors that emerge from individual cell decisions.

## How does this research help patients?
By understanding how tissues are organized and how immune cells behave in disease, we can:
- Identify better biomarkers for predicting treatment response
- Develop more effective immunotherapies
- Understand why diseases develop in the first place
- Design targeted drug delivery strategies

## What makes the Hickey Lab unique?
We combine wet lab expertise (tissue imaging) with computational skills (modeling, machine learning). This interdisciplinary approach lets us not just observe biology, but simulate and predict it.
